=============================================================================
The changes below are pre Qt 4.7.0 RC1

TextInput
   - copy(), cut() and paste() functions added
Font.letterSpacing
   - was percentage based.  Now specified in pixels.
Item
   - wantsFocus renamed to activeFocus
   - forceFocus() renamed to forceActiveFocus()
   - focus now returns the scoped focus (i.e. focus read/write now manipulate
     the same value)
TextInput and TextEdit:
   - focusOnPress renamed to activeFocusOnPress

=============================================================================
The changes below are pre Qt 4.7.0 beta 2

QDeclarativeView
   - initialSize() function added
TextInput and TextEdit: 
   - openSoftwareInputPanel() and closeSoftwareInputPanel() functions added
Flickable:
   - overShoot is replaced by boundsBehavior enumeration
   - flickingHorizontally and flickingVertically properties added
   - movingHorizontally and movingVertically properties added
   - flickDirection is renamed flickableDirection
Component:
    - isReady, isLoading, isError and isNull properties removed, use
      status property instead
    - errorsString() renamed to errorString()
ListView:
    - ListView.prevSection property changed to ListView.previousSection
TextInput:
    - xToPosition -> positionAt (to match TextEdit.positionAt)
Image:
    - pixmap property removed, use QDeclarativeImageProvider to serve pixmaps
      instead

QList<QObject*> models no longer provide properties in model object.  The
properties are now updated when the object changes.  An object's property
"foo" may now be accessed as "foo", modelData.foo" or model.modelData.foo"
component.createObject has gained a mandatory "parent" argument
TextEdit and TextInput now have a "selectByMouse" property that defaults to false.

C++ API
-------
QDeclarativeExpression::value() has been renamed to
QDeclarativeExpression::evaluate()

The QDeclarativeExpression constructor has changed from
    QDeclarativeExpression(context, expression, scope)
to
    QDeclarativeExpression(context, scope, expression, parent = 0)

QDeclarativeImageProvider::request() has been renamed to
QDeclarativeImageProvider::image() and the class can now provide
both qimages and qpixmaps, and qimages can be served synchronously

QML Viewer
------------
The standalone qml executable has been renamed back to Qml Viewer. Runtime warnings
can be now accessed via the menu (Debugging->Show Warnings).

=============================================================================
The changes below are pre Qt 4.7.0 beta 1

TextEdit: wrap property is replaced by wrapMode enumeration.
Text: wrap property is replaced by wrapMode enumeration.
Removed Q-prefix from validators (IntValidator, DoubleValidator, and RegExpValidator)
PathView: offset property now uses range 0-1.0 rather than 0-100
ListView, GridView::positionViewAtIndex() gained a 'mode' parameter
Removed Qt.playSound (replaced by SoundEffect element)
Removed Qt.closestAngle (use RotationAnimation instead)
Removed NumberFormatter
Removed DateTimeFormatter (use Qt.formatDateTime() instead)
Using WebView now requires "import QtWebKit 1.0"
Using Particles now requires "import Qt.labs.particles 1.0"
AnchorAnimation must now be used to animate anchor changes (and not NumberAnimation)
Removed ParentAction (use ParentAnimation instead)
ScriptAction: renamed stateChangeScriptName -> scriptName
Animation: replace repeat with loops (loops: Animation.Infinite gives the old repeat behavior)
AnchorChanges: use natural form to specify anchors (anchors.left instead of left)
AnchorChanges: removed reset property. (reset: "left" should now be anchors.left: undefined)
PathView: snapPosition replaced by preferredHighlightBegin, preferredHighlightEnd
createQmlObject: Moved to the Qt object, now use Qt.createQmlObject()
createComponent: Moved to the Qt object, now use Qt.createComponent()

C++ API
-------
QDeclarativeContext::addDefaultObject() has been replaced with
QDeclarativeContext::setContextObject()

Behavior and Animation syntax
-----------------------------
Previously animations and behaviors could be "assigned" to properties like this:
    Item { x: Behavior {}; y: NumberAnimation {} }
To make it more obvious that these are not regular value assignments a new "on"
syntax has been introduced:
    Item { Behavior on x {}; NumberAnimation on y {} }
Only the syntax has changed, the behavior is identical.

EaseFollow renamed to SmoothedFollow
---------------------------------------
This element shares the internal implementation with SmoothedAnimation,
both providing the same easing function, but with SmoothedFollow it's
easier to set a start value to animate intially and then start to follow,
while SmoothedAnimation is still convenient for using inside Behaviors
and Transitions.


Add SmoothedAnimation element
---------------------------------------
SmoothedAnimation inherits from NumberAnimaton and as a
consequence SmoothedAnimation can be used inside Behaviors,
as PropertySourceValues or in state transitions, like any other animation.

The old EaseFollow properties changed to comply with the other declarative
animations ('source' changed to 'to'), so now 'to' changes are not
automatically 'followed' anymore.

If you want to follow an hypothetical rect1, you should do now:

     Rectangle {
         color: "green"
         width: 60; height: 60;
         x: rect1.x - 5; y: rect1.y - 5;
         Behavior on x { SmoothedAnimation { velocity: 200 } }
         Behavior on y { SmoothedAnimation { velocity: 200 } }
     }

instead of the old automatic source changed tracking:

     Rectangle {
         color: "green"
         width: 60; height: 60;
         EaseFollow on x { source: rect1.x - 5; velocity: 200 }
         EaseFollow on y { source: rect1.y - 5; velocity: 200 }
    }

This is a syntax and behavior change.


Script element removed
----------------------
Inline Script{} blocks have been deprecated, and will soon be removed entirely.
If you used Script to write inline javascript code, it can simply be removed.
For example

Item {
    Script {
        function doSomething() {}
    }
}

becomes

Item {
    function doSomething() {}
}

If you used Script to include external JavaScript files, you can replace the
Script element with an “import” line.  For example

MouseArea {
    Script {
        source: “foo.js”
    }
    onClicked: foo()
}

becomes

import “foo.js” as Foo
MouseArea {
    onClicked: Foo.foo()
}

The “as” qualifier is mandatory for script imports (as opposed to type
imports where it is optional).


=============================================================================
The changes below are pre Qt 4.7.0 alpha

Flickable: renamed viewportWidth -> contentWidth
Flickable: renamed viewportHeight -> contentHeight
Flickable: renamed viewportX -> contentX
Flickable: renamed viewportY -> contentY
Removed Flickable.reportedVelocitySmoothing
Renamed MouseRegion -> MouseArea
Connection: syntax and rename:
    Connection { sender: a; signal: foo(); script: xxx }
    Connection { sender: a; signal: bar(); script: yyy }
  becomes:
    Connections { target: a; onFoo: xxx; onBar: yyy }

ListView::sectionExpression has been replaced by section.property, section.criteria

ListModel
---------
- types are strictly checked (previously, everything was a string)
 - foo: "bar"  continues to work as before
 - foo: bar  is now invalid, use  foo: "bar"
 - foo: true  is now a bool (not string "true")
 - foo: false  is now a bool (not string "false" == true!)

PropertyAnimation
------------------
matchProperties and matchTargets have been renamed back to properties and targets.
The semantics are explained in the PropertyAnimation::properties documentation
and the animation overview documentation.

Easing curves and their parameters are now specified via dot properties:
* easing.type : enum
* easing.amplitude : real
* easing.overshoot : real
* easing.period : real
For example:
PropertyAnimation { properties: "y"; easing.type: "InOutElastic"; easing.amplitude: 2.0; easing.period: 1.5 }

C++ API
-------
QML_DEFINE_... definition macros, previously global macros, are replaced by
qmlRegisterType registration functions, which must be called explicitly.
C++ API users should also consider using the QmlExtensionPlugin (previously
named QmlModulePlugin) as a cleaner mechanism for publishing libraries of QML
types, or the upcoming application plugin features of the qmlviewer /
qmlruntime / qml.

QmlView
-------
The API of QmlView has been narrowed and its role as a convenience class
reinforced.
- remove addItem()
- remove clearItems() - use 'delete root()'
- remove reset()
- resizeContent -> enum ResizeMode { SizeViewToRootObject, SizeRootObjectToView }
- remove setQml(), qml()
- rename setUrl(), ur() to setSource(), source()
- root() -> rootObject(),  returns QGraphicsObject rather than QmlGraphicsItem
- remove quit() signal -> use quit() signal of engine()
- initialSize() signal removed
- Added status() to determine status of the internal QmlComponent
- removed execute() - setSource() will also execute the QML.


=============================================================================
The changes below are pre-4.6.0 release.

QML API Review
==============

The QML API is being reviewed.  This file documents the changes.
Note that the changes are incremental, so a rename A->B for example may be followed
by another subsequent rename B->C, if later reviews override earlier reviews.
